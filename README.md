# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Fundamentals
    This repository contains C scripts, MATLAB live scripts and data files. 
    The resources are summed up for the exploration of fundamental concepts in DSP using C code algorithms and Matlab live
    scripts for signal analysis and presentation.
    The examples include basic signal transformations, filtering techniques, and spectral analysis.

# Repository Structure
    All the C scripts included use a raw data signal array from waveforms.c, and each one contain Makefile including it. 
    In each folder there's the file output from the script in .dat format using the general array in waveforms.c.
    The waveforms.c can be modified, and use another values for the algorithm script consumption.
## ------- Check out my wav2code-tool which includes Matlab script for generating a raw data file from .wav file. ---------

    The repository is organized into the following sections:

## 1. Complex DFT
    C script related to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for complex signals.
    Useful for analyzing the frequency components of complex-valued signals.
## 2. Convolution
    Demonstrates the convolution operation, a fundamental concept in signal processing for filtering and system response analysis.
## 3. DFT and IDFT
    Examples include processing signals like ECG.
## 4. Rectangular to Polar Transformation
    Supports tasks requiring magnitude and phase representation of signals.
## 5. Statistical Analysis
    C-scripts for calculating:
    Mean
    Variance
    Standard Deviation
    --- Useful for signal characteristics and noise analysis ---
## 6. Windowed-Sinc Filters
    Windowed-sinc BP filter: Implements a bandpass filter using the windowed-sinc method.
    Windowed-sinc LP filter: Implements a lowpass filter using the same method.
## 7. Running Sum
    Demonstrates the running sum (cumulative sum) operation, often used in integration or moving average calculations.
## 8. Data Files
    out_rex.dat and out_imx.dat: Intermediate or output files generated by certain signal processing functions.
    Likely related to DFT/IDFT computations.
## 9. Waveforms
    waveforms.c: A C file containing the signal waveforms.
