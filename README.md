# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Fundamentals
## This repository contains C scripts, MATLAB live scripts, data files, and resources for exploring fundamental concepts with C code algorithms and Matlab live
## scripts for signal analysis and output representations in Digital Signal Processing (DSP). 
## The examples include basic signal transformations, filtering techniques, and spectral analysis.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:

## 1. Complex DFT
  Scripts related to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for complex signals.
  Useful for analyzing the frequency components of complex-valued signals.
## 2. Convolution
  Demonstrates the convolution operation, a fundamental concept in signal processing for filtering and system response analysis.
## 3. DFT and IDFT
  Examples include processing signals like ECG.
## 4. Rectangular to Polar Transformation
Rectangular_to_Polar.mlx: Converts signals or frequency data from rectangular to polar coordinates.
Supports tasks requiring magnitude and phase representation of signals.
## 5. Statistical Analysis
  C-scripts for calculating:
    Mean
    Variance
    Standard Deviation
    - Useful for signal characteristics and noise analysis.
## 6. Windowed-Sinc Filters
    Windowed-sinc BP filter: Implements a bandpass filter using the windowed-sinc method.
    Windowed-sinc LP filter: Implements a lowpass filter using the same method.
7. Running Sum
Demonstrates the running sum (cumulative sum) operation, often used in integration or moving average calculations.
8. Data Files
out_rex.dat and out_imx.dat: Intermediate or output files generated by certain signal processing functions.
Likely related to DFT/IDFT computations.
9. Waveforms
waveforms.c: A C file for generating or analyzing signal waveforms.
Recent Additions
.gitignore: Added to exclude unnecessary files such as .DS_Store and other temporary files.
DFTofatwoCompSignal.mlx: A new script added for spectral analysis using DFT on two-component signals.
Setup and Requirements
Software
MATLAB: All scripts are written in MATLAB (.mlx files).
C Compiler: Required to work with waveforms.c.
Files to Ignore
The .gitignore file ensures temporary or irrelevant files are not tracked:

.vscode: Editor configuration files.
.DS_Store: macOS metadata files.
Usage Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository directory.
Run the desired .mlx scripts to explore specific DSP concepts.
