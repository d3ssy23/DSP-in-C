# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Fundamentals
    This repository contains C scripts, MATLAB live scripts, data files, and resources for exploring fundamental concepts with C code algorithms and Matlab live
    scripts for signal analysis and output representations in Digital Signal Processing (DSP). 
    The examples include basic signal transformations, filtering techniques, and spectral analysis.

# Repository Structure
    The repository is organized into the following sections:

## 1. Complex DFT
    Scripts related to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for complex signals.
    Useful for analyzing the frequency components of complex-valued signals.
## 2. Convolution
    Demonstrates the convolution operation, a fundamental concept in signal processing for filtering and system response analysis.
## 3. DFT and IDFT
    Examples include processing signals like ECG.
## 4. Rectangular to Polar Transformation
    Supports tasks requiring magnitude and phase representation of signals.
## 5. Statistical Analysis
    C-scripts for calculating:
    Mean
    Variance
    Standard Deviation
    - Useful for signal characteristics and noise analysis.
## 6. Windowed-Sinc Filters
    Windowed-sinc BP filter: Implements a bandpass filter using the windowed-sinc method.
    Windowed-sinc LP filter: Implements a lowpass filter using the same method.
## 7. Running Sum
    Demonstrates the running sum (cumulative sum) operation, often used in integration or moving average calculations.
## 8. Data Files
    out_rex.dat and out_imx.dat: Intermediate or output files generated by certain signal processing functions.
    Likely related to DFT/IDFT computations.
## 9. Waveforms
    waveforms.c: A C file containing the signal waveforms.
